// deferWork() — run work AFTER the HTTP response ("ack-then-work").
//
// Slack requires a 200 within 3 seconds, otherwise it redelivers the request
// (up to 3×). The handlers therefore return 200 as soon as the security gates
// (signature → team→org → user→role) and the idempotency claim have passed,
// and hand the actual work (answerQuestion / startRun / approve …) to
// deferWork(). The deferred task delivers its result via the Slack poster.
//
// Node default (dev / self-hosted): fire-and-forget on the already-running
// promise — the Response is returned immediately, the event loop keeps the
// task alive. Errors NEVER become unhandled rejections: they are logged and
// reported to the user in Slack via the task's onFailure callback (whose own
// failure is also only logged).
//
// PLATFORM HOOK (serverless): on runtimes that freeze the instance right after
// the response (Vercel Functions/Lambda), a fire-and-forget promise can be cut
// off. Wire the platform's keep-alive through setDeferKeepAlive() ONCE at
// startup, e.g. with Next.js 15:
//
//     import { after } from 'next/server';
//     setDeferKeepAlive((pending) => after(() => pending));
//
// (or `waitUntil` from @vercel/functions). The default keep-alive is a no-op —
// correct wherever the process simply keeps running.
//
// Tests/demo: drainDeferredWork() awaits everything currently deferred, making
// the "200 first, work afterwards" order observable and deterministic.

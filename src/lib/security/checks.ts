// =============================================================================
// SECURITY CHECKS — the honest core of the Security view.
//
// This module answers one question per structural guarantee: "is it actually
// in place right now, and how do we KNOW?". Two kinds of answer, never mixed:
//
//   • basis: 'live'         — we query the running database's SCHEMA CATALOGS
//                             (pg_class, pg_policies, pg_trigger) and report the
//                             real result. This can, and MUST be able to, come
//                             back NOT green — if someone drops FORCE or adds an
//                             UPDATE policy to audit_log, the tile flips to fail.
//                             That falsifiability is the whole point.
//
//   • basis: 'test' | 'architecture'
//                           — a guarantee that is NOT a momentary DB status
//                             (e.g. "money skills fail closed"). We do NOT fake a
//                             live green light for these. We state plainly that
//                             they are secured by the test suite / by the
//                             architecture, and point at the verifiable basis
//                             (the CI gate, the test files, the code).
//
// HONESTY RULES (do not weaken):
//   - No "certified" language, no self-issued seal. We claim only what we can
//     show: the public repo, the CI gate, the test count, the live query.
//   - A live check reads ONLY aggregated schema structure (table names, RLS
//     flags, policy/trigger existence). It never reads a tenant row, a customer
//     record, or another org's data. It runs as the least-privileged app_user.
//   - Where no honest live check exists, label it 'test'/'architecture' — never
//     a hardcoded "OK" pretending it was just verified live.

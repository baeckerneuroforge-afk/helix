// Declarative skill format.
//
// A skill is DATA, not a code special-case: a key, a title, an ordered list of
// steps, and (for skills that act) a guardrail. The engine (./engine.ts) is the
// only thing that executes skills — always inside withTenant() transactions,
// always writing skill_steps + audit_log as it goes.
//
// "liest nur" vs. "handelt":
//   - A step with `acts: false` (the default) only READS/derives — it may query
//     tenant data through ctx.tx but must not cause real-world effects.
//   - A step with `acts: true` HANDELT — it has an (possibly simulated)
//     external effect. Before the first acting step the engine enforces the
//     guardrail: if it triggers, the run pauses in `awaiting_approval` and the
//     acting step does NOT execute until a human approves.
//   - `handlesMoney: true` marks the whole skill as money-touching: the engine
//     then refuses to execute ANY acting step without a guardrail verdict —
//     a money skill without a guardrail fails closed (always needs approval).

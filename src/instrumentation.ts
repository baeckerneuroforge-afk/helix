// Next.js instrumentation hook — runs ONCE per server instance at startup.

// Wires the platform keep-alive into deferWork() (src/lib/slack/defer.ts):
// on serverless runtimes (Vercel Functions/Lambda) the instance can freeze
// right after the HTTP response, cutting off fire-and-forget promises —
// next/server's after() keeps the instance alive until the deferred work
// settles. after() must be called during a request; deferWork() only runs
// inside route handlers, so that holds. Outside a request scope (scripts,
// tests — which do not load instrumentation anyway) the call would throw, so
// it is guarded and falls back to plain fire-and-forget.

  // Until then, logError() emits structured JSON lines only.
